This is a new pure-JavaScript CSS selector engine that I'm working on.

Comes in at roughly 4x faster in Firefox 3, 3x faster in Opera 9, 1.5x faster in Safari 3 than the other major JavaScript libraries. It's completely standalone (no library dependencies) and clocks in at 4KB.

Currently this engine is expected to become the new default selector engine of jQuery, MochiKit, Prototype, and Dojo. Please contact me if you're interested in working on integrating Sizzle into your library.
